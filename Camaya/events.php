                            <p>The event was inaugurated last April 2014 with a 50KM commemorative run beginning at Balanga Provincial Capitol, going to Bagac, before climbing Mt. Samat, then returning to the Provincial Capitol. It has several family side events for the family such as 10k, 5k, 3k and 1km run for kids and pets.
 </p>
 <p>
The event gathered about 800 participants at its opening and was included in the calendar of Bataanâ€™s Veterans Week celebration. The event is the only one of its kind, providing race distances for professional runners with the Ultra marathon up to the family events of fun run distances, its also the only event that supports our dear veterans who fought and died during World War 2, wherein the proceeds of the first run was given to rehabilitation of the Bataan Death March Memorial Markers.
 </p>
 <p>
The second installment last April 2015 gathered more than 1,000 participants, with a new concept of a color run for our fun run participants we were able to gather more participants from different schools. The Ultra Marathon was also able to gather more participants given that we increased the distance from 50KM to 68.9KM, and thus moving the starting line to a more historical area, at KM Zero in Mariveles Bataan where the Veteran Survivors from the siege of Corregidor started their long march. Participants where treated to a journey in history as they passed different historical sites of the different struggles during World War 2 in Bataan. Ultra runners went from Mariveles Bataan all the way to Mt. Samat and then finishing at the Provincial Capitol.
